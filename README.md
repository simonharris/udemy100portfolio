My attempts at the portfolio exercises from the App Brewery's "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course, available via Udemy.

The assignments tackled so far are:

### [Day 82: Text to Morse Code Converter](082-MorseEncoder)
A text-based, command line program that takes a string input and converts it into Morse Code.

### [Day 83: Portfolio Website](083-PortfolioWebsite)
This assignment mainly referred back to a lesson about web design. I'm not a designer, so I subverted it into a vanity project talking about all my other harebrained projects. It's built using Flask, Vue.js and Bootstrap, and you can visit it at [projects.pointbeing.net](https://projects.pointbeing.net/).

### [Day 84: Tic Tac Toe](083-TicTacToe)
A text-based, command line version of the Tic Tac Toe game. My implementation detects the win using bitboards, which is a nice declarative solution that avoids convoluted looping.

### [Day 93: Custom Web Scraper](093-WebScraper)
I use this IRL to scrape my own site ([musiclivecolchester.com](https://musiclivecolchester.com/)), thereby using existing data and algorithms as a starting point for generating the monthly [MusicLiveCOLCHESTER BUZZ](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3x3h7qglnsP47QFxC4pgHg?si=6a5254c53b2047c0) Spotify playlists.

### [Day 98: Custom Automation](093-CustomeAutomation)
Some monitoring scripts for some of my sites and services, using Selenium/WebDriver and Pytest.
