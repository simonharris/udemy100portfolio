<p><a href="https://musiclivecolchester.com/">Music Live COLCHESTER</a> is the only comprehensive live music listings
    site for Colchester, Essex.</p>


<p>Colchester has a remarkable, thriving live music scene---just look at the site to
    see what's on---so I was surprised to find nothing like this existed. Well, now it does, and
    considering it's a little niche, it's pretty popular.</p>

<p>
    It's really more a platform than a site, in that it can support multiple sites, each
     with their own view on the data. Aside from other towns, think of artists, venues, promoters
    and so forth, each with their own site based on the platform.</p>

<p>The project is built in Python on the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> framework. The canonical data store is
    <a href="https://www.mysql.com.">MySQL</a>, whilst I also make use of a <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a> graph database behind the scenes (for related artists, artist network etc)
    and <a hfref="https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> for indexing. Since around 70-80% of the site's traffic is mobile,
    a responsive interface is key, and this is facilitated by the invaluable <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> tookit.</p>
