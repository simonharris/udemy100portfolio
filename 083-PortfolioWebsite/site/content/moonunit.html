<p>LIke many people, I moved my scant online social activities over to
    <a href="https://bsky.app/">Bluesky</a> a while ago, and have found the
    platform pretty interesting.</p>

<p>Not so much the social network aspect of it, but the underlying architecture
    and protocol, which empowers a user to own their own part of the network under their own
    domain. More importantly, thereby to own and control their own data.</p>

<p>I host my own Bluesky PDS under the colchester.social domain. Among other things,
    I set to knocking up a couple of Bluesky bots written in Python, for example
    <a href="https://moonunit.colchester.social/">Moon Unit</a>. This basically just
    tells you all about what the moon is up to, with regards to phases and illumination (with help from
<a href="https://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/">PyEphem</a>) and bits and bob of trivia.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/simonharris/moonunit">Python source code</a> is, of course,
    all on GitHub, along with <a href="https://github.com/simonharris">much of my other junk</a>.</p>


<p>I've chosen to feature Moon Unit on this site, but other bots are in the offing. For example
    there's <a href="https://tide.colchester.social/">tide.colchester.social</a>,
which tells you all about what's happening with the tidal bits of the Colne, here in Colchester.</p>

I mean, I live on the riverside, so could conceivably just look out the window at what the river
and the moon are doing, but hopefully some of it all is  useful to someone, and these
have proven to be fun projects to work on.</p>
