<p>The <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/">original Wiki</a>, developed by Ward Cunningham in the mid 90s, was a quantum leap,
    both technologically and socially: a key step in democratisation of the web.
Previously, to contribute to the web, one had to be a computer scientist in a
university or research institute somewhere, with a server under your desk.</p>

<p>Of course, since the only people with web access in those days still <em>were</em> computer scientists,
the content was somewhat niche, and grew into a great resource for aspiring software
engineers like me.</p>

</p>This is my tribute to it, and an experiment in how easy it would be to recreate the Wiki
using modern technologies like Python and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>.
It's all up there on the web itself:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/simonharris/django-wikiwikiweb">Source code on Github</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-wikiwikiweb/PyPI">Official project page on PyPI</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://django-wikiwikiweb.readthedocs.io/">Documentation on Read the Docs</a></li>
</ul>


<p>I'm at a crossroads with the project. Should it stay as close as possible to the
    spirit of the original, or should it embrace the things modern users expect from such
    as system, like rich text editing and social features? Rest assured I won't be
    replicating the egregious single-page interface Ward inexplicably grafted onto it in recent years.</p>

    <p>I'll revisit it one day,
    but in the meantime I use it myself, and find it pretty useful.</p>
