<p><a href="https://github.com/simonharris/pykmeans">pykmeans</a> is the Python
    code used to run the experiments for my MSc by dissertation---a postgraduate
    research degree--in Computer Science, specifically Machine Learning.</p>

<p>The title of the thesis was <i>An Extensive Empirical Comparison of K-means
    Initialization Algorithms</i>, and the library uses scikit-learn and implements
    concurrency using <code>futures.ProcessPoolExecutor</code>.

<p>It's all on github, under the MIT licence. In fact, the project deliverables included three libraries in total. See also:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/simonharris/pygendata">pygendata</a> for generating synthetic data sets</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/simonharris/pycleandata">pycleandata</a> for cleaning real-world data sets, typically from ...

        pandas</li>
</ul>

<p>They all use <a href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> and
    <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a> quite a bit, and I forget
    what else.</p>

<p>Well, I got my degree, and my research got published as
    "<i>An Extensive Empirical Comparison of K-means Initialization Algorithms</i>" in IEEE Access, so it must have done its job!</p>
