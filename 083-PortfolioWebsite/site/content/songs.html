    <p>After progress on <a href="/threehundredbeers">Thre Hundred Beers</a> slowed a little,
        I was casting around for another writing project. I've always believed the humble pop
        song to be an underrated art forn, so here's
            my little tribute to some great songs and their writers.</p>

            <p>It's another my-site-my-rules project, so don't axpect any coherent
                modus operandi. I've covered everything from
    <a href="https://threehundredsongs.com/37-geneve-john-otway">John Otway</a>
    to
    <a href="https://threehundredsongs.com/27-joe-le-taxi-vanessa-paradis">Vanessa Paradis</a>, and quite a lot in between.

            -->


    <p>I've also branched out into things like book reports, for example
        <a href="https://threehundredsongs.com/mainlines-blood-feasts-bad-taste-lester-bangs">Mainlines,
            Blood Feasts &amp;Bad Taste</a> by Lester Bangs, and <a href="https://threehundredsongs.com/how-to-write-one-song-jeff-tweedy">How to Write One Song</a> by Jeff Tweedy.</p>

    <p>But it's always going to be about the song. I've a handful of pieces in progress,
        though other projects have been staking claim to my time recently.</p>
