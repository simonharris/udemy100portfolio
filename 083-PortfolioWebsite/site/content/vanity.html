    As the name suggests, django-vanityurls was originally designed to support vanity URLs---short,
     memorable routes to content deeper within your site, but it has
     proven to be more generally applicable to any internal redirects.</p>

<p> It's a Django middleware that jumps in after routing has happened, and
    only does its stuff if routing generates a 404. If the requested URL is in
    the database, it issues the redirect with the HTTP response code of your choice.</p>

<p>You can install it via <code>pip install vanity-urls</code>, and everything you need is online:</p>

<p>It's only a tiny project, but I've found it useful, and it's in use behind
     <a href="/musiclivecolchester">Music Live COLCHESTER</a>. As a smaller project
     I've taken the opportunity to be a bit relentless with the professional practices, so for example
     there is 100% test coverage, and the code lints to 10/10.</p>
