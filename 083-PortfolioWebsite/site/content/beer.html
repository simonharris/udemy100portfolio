<p>This writing project was my attempt to locate and document every beer in <a href="https://protzonbeer.co.uk/">Roger Protz</a>'s
classic book
"<a href="https://shop1.camra.org.uk/product/300-beers-to-try-before-you-die-2nd-edition/">Three Hundred
     Beers to Try Before You Die</a>". It seemed easy at first.</p>

<p>More than a decade later I've reached
    <a href="https://threehundredbeers.com/kernel-brewery-pale-ale-simcoe-amarillo">173</a>,
    and only then through chicanery and an unequivocal
    <a href="https://threehundredbeers.com/some-thoughts-on-discontinued-beers">my site, my rules</a>
    policy. It has been fun, though: so far it has taken me to Belgium, France, Scotland and,

er, Swindon. Highlights include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A <a href="https://threehundredbeers.com/a-visit-to-cantillon">self-guided tour</a>
        of the venerable Cantillon brewery in Brussels</li>
    <li>A day trip that turned into <a href="https://threehundredbeers.com/tagged/la-capsule">a bit of a Saturday night</a> at La Capsule, Lille</li>
    <li>A <a href="https://threehundredbeers.com/burton-bridge-empire-pale-ale">jaunt
        to Burton-on-Trent</a> with the late Official Threehundredbeers Sister to
        find a rare British classic in convivial circumstances</li>
    </ul>

</p>

The project is kind of on hiatus since I don't tend to drink any more these days,
but there are a couple of rarities in the back of the kitchen cupboard, so never say never.
